##NOTES:
At the moment we use the DarkSky API.

In order to store access data and keys we have (to create) a folder named "data". 
There you have to create a file with your DarkSky token named DarkSkyAPIkey.txt
or a file named metero with your id in the first line and psw in the second line. 


##ABOUT:
Project to controll the charging process of an 12V battery or outlets via a raspberry pi. 
The goal is to check when there is the "greenest" energy in the grid, through weatherforecasts, and shedule our outlets/battery to those peeks.

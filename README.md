##NOTES:
At the moment we use the DarkSky API.

In order to access data we have to create a folder named "data" in 
the same directory as this file and create a file "DarkSkyAPIkey.txt"
there, which holds an valid access key in the first line. 

##ABOUT:
Project to controll the charging process of an 12V battery or outlets via a raspberry pi. 
The goal is to check when there is the "greenest" energy in the grid, through weatherforecasts, and shedule our outlets/battery to those peeks.
